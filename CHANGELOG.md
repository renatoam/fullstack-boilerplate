# Changelog

O que fazer e abaixo, exemplo de changelog

Aplicar classes para chamadas api (que faltam) e filtragens

Verificar onde dá pra usar HOC

Aplicar uso do React Query

Aplicar Typescript

Aplicar Code Splitting*
  Verificar onde dá pra usar Dynamic Imports
  Criar um Error Boundary pra lidar com erros caso o carregamento dinâmico falhar (melhora a UX)
  Vericar onde dá pra usar o React.lazy**, que deixa a gente usar componentes dinamicamente importados como componente mesmo
    - Verificar o uso do loadable components, porque tem mais recursos do que o React.lazy. Ex.:
      - permite importar dinamicamente uma lib também (library splitting)
      - permite interpolar o path do import com variáveis (React.lazy não permite template string)
      - apesar de também poder ser usado com Suspense, loadable não é dependente dele. React.lazy precisa ser usado com Suspense, que por ora só serve pra ser usado com React.lazy, não adianta usar com outro recurso, como hooks.
    - Não preciso usar Loadable Components se estiver no Next, pois este tem seu próprio dynamic import, dar uma olhada antes de usar o outro - <https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import>

Aplicar a estrutura de Axios do CRED

Aplicar a estrutura de notificações do CRED

Verificar as possibilidades de integrações com o CRED

Verificar se vale a pena transformar em PWA (service worker, manifest.json)

\*: *Code Splitting*
*Bundling is great, but as your app grows, your bundle will grow too. Especially if you are including large third-party libraries. You need to keep an eye on the code you are including in your bundle so that you don’t accidentally make it so large that your app takes a long time to load.*

*To avoid winding up with a large bundle, it’s good to get ahead of the problem and start “splitting” your bundle. Code-Splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack, Rollup and Browserify (via factor-bundle) which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.*

*Code-splitting your app can help you “lazy-load” just the things that are currently needed by the user, which can dramatically improve the performance of your app. While you haven’t reduced the overall amount of code in your app, you’ve avoided loading code that the user may never need, and reduced the amount of code needed during the initial load.*
