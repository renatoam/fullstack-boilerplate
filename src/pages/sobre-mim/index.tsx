          Front-End Developer completely in love with the profession, I discovered that one of my
          favorite hobbies - and I have many - is to study programming. Today, I consider myself a
          web development evangelist. With daily study and participation in renowned projects such
          as Carrefour, Peugeot/Citroen, Hering, SESC, government projects, among others, I keep
          myself focused on the goal of becoming a full web developer, Javascript skilled. The full
          web developer that I want to become can handle from conception to solution delivery, going
          through User Experience and User Interface development, delivering front-end, back -end
          and mobile, and ensuring the application deploy. Of course that I don't want to become a
          specialist in all these stuffs, that's impossible, but having this background, although
          difficult, is very poss√≠vel. The road is long, but so pleasant. This is the way!
